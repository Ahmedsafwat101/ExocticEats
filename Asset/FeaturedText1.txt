A tagine is a traditional Berber meal from North Africa, named after the clay dish the meal is cooked in. The dish contains a base with low sides and a large cone that loosely sits on the base. The cone-shaped cover is designed to return condensation from steam produced while cooking to the bottom dish, ensuring a rich, juicy infusion of flavor.
