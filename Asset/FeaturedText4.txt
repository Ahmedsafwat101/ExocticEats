German potato dumplings, or "kartoffelkloesse," are an old-fashioned comfort food, and they are often served with the Sunday roast and then rewarmed with the leftover gravy on Monday. Serve with a hot green vegetable like peas, green beans or broccoli or roasted Brussels sprouts and warmed white German bread.
